# Version 2.0 Release update - Dec 19, 2024

## New & Improved
- Added the low income burden to American Samoa, Guam, the Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands
- Tracts in these territories that are completely surrounded by disadvantaged tracts and exceed an adjusted low income threshold are now considered disadvantaged
- Additionally, census tracts in these four Territories are now considered disadvantaged if they meet the low income threshold only, because these Territories are not included in the nationally-consistent datasets on environmental and climate burdens used in the tool
Updated the data in the workforce development category to the Census Decennial 2020 data for the U.S. territories of Guam, Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa
- Made improvements to the low income burden to better identify college students before they are excluded from that burdenâ€™s percentile
- Census tracts that were disadvantaged under version 1.0 continue to be considered as disadvantaged in version 2.0
## Technical Fixes
- For tracts that have water boundaries, e.g. coastal or island tracts, the water boundaries are now excluded from the calculation to determine if a tract is 100% surrounded by disadvantaged census tracts
## User Interface Improvements
- Added the ability to search by census tract ID
- The basemap has been updated to use a free, open source map
